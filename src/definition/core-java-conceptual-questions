Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
Ans:JAVA is a Programming Language and a Computing Platform for Application Development.
JAVA Platform is a Collection of Programs that help to Develop and run Programs written in the JAVA Programming Language.
JAVA Platform includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of Libraries.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans:The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides the foundation upon which all applications that are targeted toward the Java platform are built.
The JDK includes a variety of tools and utilities that perform a variety of tasks, which include compiling source code into bytecode, packaging applications, spinning up Java virtual machines (JVMs) and managing the runtime environment of Java applications.
  JDK components, tools and utilities
  The bin directory of the JDK provides a variety of features and tools that aid in the software development process. Some of the more popular JDK utilities include:
  •	javac: This utility is used to compile Java source code into Java bytecode.
  •	rmic: This utility creates skeletons and stubs for use in Remote Method
                Invocation (RMI).
  •	jar: This compression utility aggregates a multitude of files into a single
              Java Archive (JAR) file. The jar utility uses a standard compression
              Algorithm used by all of the most common zip utilities.
  •	javadoc: This utility can examine the names of classes and the methods
              contained within a class, as well as consume special annotations in
              order to create application programming interface (API) documentation
              for Java code.
  •	wsgen: This generates various artifacts required by Java API for XML Web
                   Services (JAX-WS).
  •	javap: This utility disassembles class files, generating information about the
                  methods, properties and attributes of a given compiled component.

What is IDE?
Ans:A Java IDE (for Integrated Development Environment) is a software application, which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs.
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: Many IDEs provide features like syntax highlighting and code completion, which help the user to code more easily.
   •	Eclipse. This open source IDE has long been one of the most reliable and oft-
      used IDEs. ...
   •	NetBeans. This open source IDE is easy to install, can run across different
      platforms, and is easy to use. ...
   •	BlueJ. ...
   •	IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. ...
   •	jEdit. ...
   •	DrJava. ...
   •	Android Studio. ...
   •	JCreator.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans. Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when we type source code in a text editor to the point that source code is converted into machine code (0’s and 1’s).
     There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:
     •	Editing the program
     •	Compiling the source code
     •	Executing the byte code
     First, you will start with typing the program in a text-editor (ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc). After completing editing of the program, we have to save the file. While saving the file you should remember that the file must be saved with. Java extension. For example, let’s think that I had written a Java program, which contains a single class Sample (more on classes in future posts). It is a good convention to save the file with the name of the class. So, as per my example, the file will be saved as Sample.java.
     Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code which is available in Sample.java. The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file. As per my example, the bytecode file will be Sample. Class.
     Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.
